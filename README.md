## About

idplatform is a Java program to manage user accounts. The platform generates universally unique identifier(UUID) strings that are assigned to users. The UUID's can be given directly or emailed to users to invite them to create a user account. You have the option to add user information at UUID generation, and you can make those fields optional or mandatory for customers to fill out after accepting invitation for account creation.
